╭───────────────────────── Revaluation Recommendation ─────────────────────────╮
│ YES - Re-evaluation Recommended                                              │

│ Expected New Range: EC-10 to EC-11                                           │
│ Confidence: 88%                                                              │

│ The position description has been materially elevated across multiple        │
│ classification categories, moving beyond typical EC-10 expectations. While   │
│ EC-10 positions 'may take a leader role in small projects or routine         │
│ operations,' this revised description explicitly positions the PRA as        │
│ leading complex policy formulation, implementation, and research             │
│ initiatives—a scope that approaches EC-11 expectations. Key elevations       │
│ include: (1) Accountabilities now include leading comprehensive policy       │
│ analysis and research, building strategic stakeholder relationships, and     │
│ providing mentorship—moving from supporting others to actively leading and   │
│ developing colleagues; (2) Decision-making authority has expanded from       │
│ 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies' to leading        │
│ development of new policy and legislative frameworks addressing 'complex and │
│ emerging issues'; (3) Leadership responsibilities now explicitly include     │
│ mentorship and contributing to organizational culture—typical of EC-11       │
│ rather than EC-10; (4) Project management scope elevated from managing       │
│ 'medium complex to moderately complex projects' to leading development of    │
│ policy and legislative frameworks. The language shift from 'advising' to     │
│ 'provides high-level analysis, strategic advice, and well-developed          │
│ recommendations to inform decision-making by senior leadership' and from     │
│ 'may be required' to 'is frequently called upon' indicates increased         │
│ autonomy and strategic influence. However, the position remains within a     │
│ single functional area (policy and research) under clear supervisory         │
│ direction (Director approval required for expenditures and final             │
│ recommendations), which prevents classification at EC-11 or higher with      │
│ certainty. The mentorship component is situational rather than permanent,    │
│ and no direct reports are managed. This positions the role at the upper      │
│ boundary of EC-10 or lower EC-11, warranting formal re-evaluation to         │
│ determine appropriate placement.                                             │

Risk Assessment: HIGH

Classification Categories Affected:
  • Accountabilities - elevated from supporting/assisting to leading complex 
initiatives; new mentorship responsibility
  • Knowledge & Experience - requirement for 'deep' expertise and sophisticated 
research capabilities; new requirement to mentor others on methodologies
  • Decision Making - authority expanded from analyzing within defined policies 
to leading development of frameworks for complex/emerging issues
  • Customer & Relationship Management - elevated from 'working with' to 
'collaborates with' and 'builds/maintains strategic relationships' as core 
accountability
  • Leadership - new explicit mentorship responsibility and culture-building 
contribution; elevated from supporting to leading implementation
  • Project Management - emphasis shifted from 'plans, leads, coordinates, or 
supports' to leading development of policy and legislative frameworks

Key Factors:
  • Explicit elevation from 'conducting' to 'leading' complex policy formulation
and implementation initiatives—moves beyond EC-10 'may take a leader role' 
language
  • New mentorship accountability with responsibility to contribute to 'culture 
of analytical rigor and innovation'—typical of EC-11 leadership expectations, 
not routine EC-10
  • Decision-making authority expanded to lead development of new policy and 
legislative frameworks addressing complex and emerging issues—exceeds EC-10 
'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies'
  • Strategic relationship-building accountability added as core 
responsibility—elevates from EC-10 'assists in development' to active leadership
of stakeholder engagement
  • Requirement for 'deep subject-matter expertise' and 'sophisticated research 
and environmental scanning'—reflects deeper specialization expected at EC-11
  • Increased autonomy in determining methodology and approach to 
assignments—moves toward EC-11 'significant autonomy' language
  • Scope of influence expanded to inform decision-making by Associate Deputy 
Minister, CEO, and Minister—higher-level strategic impact than typical EC-10
