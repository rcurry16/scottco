│ YES - Re-evaluation Recommended                                              │

│ Expected New Range: EC-10 to EC-11                                           │
│ Confidence: 88%                                                              │

│ The position description has been materially elevated across multiple        │
│ classification categories, moving beyond typical EC-10 expectations. While   │
│ EC-10 positions 'may take a leader role in small projects or routine         │
│ operations,' this revised description explicitly positions the PRA as        │
│ leading complex policy formulation, implementation, and research             │
│ initiatives—a scope that approaches EC-11 expectations. Key elevations       │
│ include: (1) Accountabilities now include leading comprehensive policy       │
│ analysis and research, building strategic stakeholder relationships, and     │
│ providing mentorship—moving from supporting others to actively leading and   │
│ developing colleagues; (2) Decision-making authority has expanded from       │
│ 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies' to leading        │
│ development of new policy and legislative frameworks addressing 'complex and │
│ emerging issues'; (3) Leadership responsibilities now explicitly include     │
│ mentorship and contributing to organizational culture—typical of EC-11       │
│ rather than EC-10; (4) Knowledge requirements elevated from 'subject-matter  │
│ expertise as required' to 'deep subject-matter expertise' with sophisticated │
│ research and environmental scanning capabilities. The position now regularly │
│ advises Executive Council, Cabinet committees, and senior leadership         │
│ (Minister, ADM, CEO) on strategic matters—a scope that exceeds typical EC-10 │
│ advisory roles. However, the position remains within a single functional     │
│ area (policy and research), reports to a Director (not independently), and   │
│ does not manage permanent staff, which are EC-10 characteristics. The        │
│ ambiguity between EC-10 and EC-11 warrants formal re-evaluation to determine │
│ appropriate classification.                                                  │

Risk Assessment: HIGH

Classification Categories Affected:
  • Accountabilities - elevated from supporting implementation to leading 
complex policy formulation, implementation, and research initiatives; new 
mentorship accountability
  • Knowledge & Experience - elevated from 'subject-matter expertise as 
required' to 'deep subject-matter expertise'; new requirement for sophisticated 
research and environmental scanning
  • Decision Making - elevated from analyzing issues within clearly defined 
policies to leading development of policy frameworks addressing complex and 
emerging issues; increased autonomy in methodology selection
  • Customer & Relationship Management - elevated from 'working with' 
stakeholders to 'collaborates with' and 'builds and maintains strategic 
relationships'; new focus on supporting implementation through relationship 
management
  • Leadership - new explicit mentorship responsibility; new accountability for 
contributing to organizational culture; elevated from supporting to leading 
implementation of policy and legislative changes
  • Project Management - elevated emphasis on 'leads' complex policy 
initiatives; new responsibility for leading comprehensive policy analysis and 
research projects; expanded scope from individual projects to policy and 
legislative frameworks

Key Factors:
  • Explicit shift from 'supporting' to 'leading' complex policy initiatives and
implementation—exceeds EC-10 'may take a leader role' language
  • New mentorship and guidance responsibilities to colleagues on policy 
development and research methodologies—elevates beyond EC-10 peer support 
expectations
  • Authority to lead development of new policy and legislative frameworks 
addressing complex and emerging issues—moves beyond EC-10's 'clearly defined 
policies' scope
  • Strategic stakeholder relationship building and representation of government
interests to external bodies—exceeds typical EC-10 customer relationship 
management
  • Requirement for 'deep subject-matter expertise' with sophisticated research 
and environmental scanning—elevates knowledge expectations beyond EC-10 baseline
  • Regular high-level advisory role to Executive Council, Cabinet committees, 
and senior leadership (Minister, ADM, CEO)—scope suggests EC-11 influence level
  • Contribution to organizational culture of 'analytical rigor and 
innovation'—leadership expectation typical of EC-11
  • Autonomy in determining methodology for policy projects based on 
professional knowledge—suggests greater decision-making independence than 
typical EC-10
