│ Current Level: EC-10                                                         │
│ Expected New Range: EC-10 to EC-11                                           │
│ Confidence: 88%                                                              │

│ The position description has been materially elevated across multiple        │
│ classification categories, moving beyond typical EC-10 expectations. While   │
│ EC-10 positions 'may take a leader role in small projects or routine         │
│ operations,' this revised role now explicitly 'leads complex policy          │
│ formulation, implementation, and research initiatives' and 'frequently       │
│ called upon to design and lead the development of new or revised policy and  │
│ legislative frameworks that address complex and emerging issues.' This       │
│ represents a shift from supporting/advising to leading strategic             │
│ initiatives. The addition of formal mentorship responsibilities ('Provides   │
│ guidance and mentorship to colleagues on policy development processes and    │
│ research methodologies, contributing to a culture of analytical rigor and    │
│ innovation') and strategic stakeholder relationship building elevates        │
│ leadership expectations beyond EC-10 baseline. The language shift from       │
│ 'advising senior leadership' to 'provides high-level analysis, strategic     │
│ advice, and well-developed recommendations to inform decision-making' by     │
│ ADM/CEO/Minister, combined with new accountability for comprehensive policy  │
│ analysis and research leadership, suggests the role now operates at the      │
│ lower-to-mid range of EC-11 expectations. However, the position remains      │
│ within a single functional area (policy/research) without direct permanent   │
│ reports, which constrains elevation to EC-11 ceiling. The sophistication of  │
│ decision-making (environmental scanning, forward-looking recommendations,    │
│ complex/emerging issues) and expanded leadership scope (mentorship,          │
│ stakeholder strategy) warrant formal re-evaluation.                          │

Risk Assessment: HIGH

Classification Categories Affected:
  • Accountabilities: Elevated from supporting/coordinating to leading complex 
initiatives; new mentorship and strategic relationship-building accountabilities
  • Knowledge & Experience: Requirement elevated to 'deep subject-matter 
expertise' and sophisticated research/environmental scanning capabilities; new 
requirement to mentor on methodologies
  • Decision Making: Shift from 'advising' to 'provides high-level analysis, 
strategic advice'; proactive design/leadership vs. reactive conduct; greater 
autonomy in methodology selection
  • Customer & Relationship Management: New explicit accountability to build and
maintain strategic stakeholder relationships; expanded from supporting to 
leading stakeholder engagement
  • Leadership: New formal mentorship responsibility; new accountability to lead
policy/legislative framework development; contribution to organizational culture
  • Project Management: Elevated from supporting/coordinating implementation to 
leading comprehensive policy analysis and research initiatives

Key Factors:
  • Shift from 'conducting' to 'leading' complex policy formulation and 
implementation—moves beyond EC-10's 'may take a leader role' to consistent 
leadership accountability
  • New explicit mentorship and guidance responsibility with organizational 
culture contribution—elevates leadership beyond EC-10 baseline of 'coaches 
others' to formal development role
  • Elevated decision-making from 'advising' to 'provides high-level analysis, 
strategic advice, and well-developed recommendations to inform decision-making' 
for senior executives (ADM/CEO/Minister)—suggests greater autonomy and influence
than typical EC-10
  • New accountability for 'comprehensive policy analysis and research' 
leadership and 'sophisticated research, environmental scanning, and creative and
strategic thinking'—exceeds EC-10's 'analyses specific issues within clearly 
defined policies'
  • Strategic stakeholder relationship building as core accountability—moves 
beyond EC-10's 'assists in development' to leading stakeholder engagement for 
implementation
  • Requirement for 'deep subject-matter expertise' and knowledge of policy 
development processes to mentor others—suggests deeper specialization than 
EC-10's 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field'
  • Proactive vs. reactive framing: 'frequently called upon to design and lead' 
vs. 'regularly called upon to conduct'—indicates greater strategic initiative
