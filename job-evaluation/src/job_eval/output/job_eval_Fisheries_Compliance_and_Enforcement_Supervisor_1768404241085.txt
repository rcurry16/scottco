TOOL 2: RE-EVALUATION GAUGE
================================================================================

Should Re-evaluate:
  YES

Confidence:
  92%

Current Level:
  EC-Unknown

Likely New Level Range:
  EC-11 to EC-12

Risk Assessment:
  HIGH

Rationale:
  The position description has undergone substantial material changes that elevate responsibilities significantly beyond typical EC-Unknown expectations. The role has evolved from a general supervisory position with basic compliance oversight to a specialized leadership and subject-matter-expert role with multi-dimensional accountability. Key elevating factors: (1) Explicit designation as 'primary source of compliance and enforcement expertise' with responsibility for developing legally-sound standards and procedures; (2) Addition of strategic intelligence analysis and complex investigation coordination responsibilities; (3) Expanded leadership scope including professional development mentorship on specialized topics (search warrants, Charter rights, judicial processes); (4) Participation in risk-based departmental planning and policy development; (5) Authority to make recommendations on legislative and procedural changes; (6) Coordination of inter-agency and cross-jurisdictional operations; (7) Special Constable appointment with law enforcement decision-making authority. These changes indicate movement toward EC-11 (specialized supervisory/expert role with policy influence) or EC-12 (senior specialist with significant decision-making authority and external coordination responsibilities). The position now carries accountability for ensuring consistency across enforcement activities, developing training curricula, and contributing to departmental strategy—responsibilities that exceed standard supervisory scope.

Key Factors:
    • Explicit designation as primary source of expertise and training authority for Fisheries Inspectors—elevates from supervisor to subject-matter-expert leader
    • Addition of strategic intelligence analysis and complex investigation coordination responsibilities—introduces analytical and investigative complexity beyond routine supervision
    • Responsibility for developing and updating legally-sound standards, policies and procedures—indicates policy development authority typically at EC-11+
    • Participation in departmental risk-based planning and cross-agency/cross-departmental planning teams—elevates scope beyond regional operations to strategic planning
    • Authority to make recommendations on legislation, operational policies and procedures—indicates influence on departmental direction
    • Special Constable appointment with law enforcement decision-making authority (search warrants, evidence handling, charge laying)—adds legal/enforcement complexity
    • Expanded knowledge requirements including Charter of Rights and Freedoms, judicial processes, and investigative techniques—indicates specialized legal/procedural expertise
    • Public education and inter-agency liaison responsibilities—expands customer/stakeholder management beyond internal operations
    • Responsibility for auditing and analyzing inspections/investigations and providing feedback—indicates quality assurance and process improvement authority
    • Context of $2.5B seafood export industry and organized crime involvement—indicates high-stakes operational environment

Categories Affected:
    • Accountabilities—substantially expanded from general supervision to specialized compliance/enforcement expertise, intelligence analysis, policy development, and complex investigation coordination
    • Knowledge & Experience—elevated to include specialized legal knowledge (Charter, search warrants, judicial processes), investigative techniques, and requirement to maintain comprehensive expertise across multiple regulatory frameworks
    • Decision Making—expanded from operational decisions to include law enforcement authority (Special Constable), recommendations on policy/legislative changes, and authority to direct enforcement actions
    • Leadership—elevated from basic supervision to mentorship on specialized topics, development of standards and procedures, and serving as primary expertise source
    • Customer & Relationship Management—expanded to include public education, inter-agency coordination, and participation in joint operations with federal/provincial agencies
    • Project Management—added responsibility for strategic planning participation, complex investigation coordination, and cross-agency operation management


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOOL 3: CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Position Title:
  Fisheries Compliance and Enforcement Supervisor

Recommended Level:
  EC-11

Confidence:
  88%

Previous Level:
  EC-Unknown

Change Context Used:
  Yes

Rationale:
  This position demonstrates clear EC-11 classification characteristics across all six categories. The role has evolved substantially from a general supervisory position to a specialized leadership and subject-matter-expert role with multi-dimensional accountability. The incumbent serves as the primary source of compliance and enforcement expertise, with responsibility for developing legally-sound standards and procedures, mentoring specialized staff on complex legal and investigative topics, coordinating complex investigations and prosecutions, and contributing to policy development. The position requires broad and deep knowledge of specialized fields (fisheries legislation, enforcement procedures, investigative techniques, Charter rights, judicial processes), operates with significant autonomy in decision-making within defined policy frameworks while making recommendations on policy/legislative improvements, and exercises law enforcement authority as a Special Constable. The role involves leading small to medium-sized projects (complex investigations, joint operations), managing cross-functional and cross-agency coordination, and providing technical direction to less experienced staff. These characteristics align precisely with EC-11 standards: managerial direction for small function/operating units of highly skilled staff, deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge, decision-making where situations are often grey/ambiguous requiring significant judgment, and leadership of small to medium-sized projects. The position does not reach EC-12 level because it lacks responsibility for high-level revenue/cost containment contributions of significant importance, does not manage a complete business function or process, and does not have the broader organizational scope characteristic of EC-12 roles.

Category Analysis:
    Accountabilities: EC-11 level. The position demonstrates accountability for a specific business function (fisheries compliance and enforcement operations) with multiple complex sub-accountabilities: (1) primary source of expertise and training for specialized staff on complex legal/investigative topics; (2) development of legally-sound standards, policies and procedures; (3) coordination and support for complex investigations and prosecutions; (4) contribution to risk-based planning and policy development; (5) direct inspection and enforcement duties; (6) inter-agency coordination and joint operations. These responsibilities exceed EC-10 (which involves providing managerial direction for small functions with routine operations) because they involve non-routine, complex, specialized work requiring expert judgment. They do not reach EC-12 level because they do not encompass responsibility for high-level revenue/cost containment or management of complete business processes across multiple functions.
    Knowledge Experience: EC-11 level. The position requires broad and deep knowledge in specialized fields: comprehensive understanding of fisheries legislation (FCRA, FHOSA), regulations, investigative techniques, legal procedures (search warrants, Charter of Rights and Freedoms, judicial processes, appeals), prosecution procedures, and intelligence analysis. The incumbent must maintain current expertise through ongoing training and conferences, and must be capable of training others on these complex topics. This demonstrates 'deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge' characteristic of EC-11, exceeding EC-10 which requires 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field' but with less depth. The requirement to understand how enforcement activities interact with multiple agencies and regulatory frameworks, and to contribute to policy development, indicates the conceptual understanding expected at EC-11.
    Decision Making: EC-11 level. The position involves analyzing specific issues, procedures and enforcement approaches within clearly defined legislative and policy frameworks, but with significant autonomy and judgment required. The incumbent makes decisions on: complex investigation strategies, enforcement actions, prosecution recommendations, policy/procedure development, and risk mitigation measures. The position description explicitly states the incumbent 'provides input into the development of operational policies, procedures, and legislation' and 'provides a field operations perspective on the practicality and enforceability of existing and proposed legislation.' These decisions often involve grey/ambiguous situations requiring significant judgment (e.g., determining appropriate enforcement response, evaluating complex investigation evidence). This matches EC-11 standard: 'Provides recommendations on improving procedure & processes where situations are often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required.' The Special Constable appointment grants law enforcement authority, elevating decision-making autonomy beyond EC-10.
    Customer Relationship: EC-11 level. The position involves multiple stakeholder relationships: (1) internal coaching and mentoring of Fisheries Inspectors; (2) consultation with Crown Prosecutors and court officials as a department expert; (3) liaison with multiple federal and provincial agencies (DFO, Environment Canada, CFIA, CBSA, CRA, provincial enforcement groups); (4) public education and engagement with user groups, industry sectors, and communities; (5) two-way communication with management. These relationships go beyond EC-10 (which involves assisting in development of customer service enhancements and seeking new avenues for relationships) to actively coaching others on relationship management, serving as expert advisor to external agencies, and developing integrated approaches with other leaders. This aligns with EC-11: 'Seeks our new avenues for building internal & external relationships; maintains on going, contact with existing relationships; coaches others on relationship management.'
    Leadership: EC-11 level. The position involves: (1) oversight of regional Fisheries Inspectors (supervisory responsibility); (2) providing training, coaching and mentorship on specialized topics (standards of conduct, professionalism, ethics, legal procedures, investigative techniques); (3) establishing and communicating compliance priorities and work plans; (4) serving as primary source of expertise and procedural support; (5) developing standards and procedures for the team. The incumbent 'establishes & communicates common goals & direction for team, coaches others on how to enhance communication, problem solving team work & innovation' which is characteristic of EC-11. The role does not reach EC-12 because it does not involve establishing and communicating direction for a complete functional area or coordinating cross-functional communication at that broader level.
    Project Management: EC-11 level. The position involves managing small to medium-sized projects: (1) complex investigations requiring coordination of multiple inspectors and evidence; (2) large-scale joint forces operations with other jurisdictions; (3) covert operations; (4) cross-departmental and cross-agency planning team participation; (5) development of issue-specific compliance plans. The incumbent 'coordinates special investigations such as large-scale joint forces operations, those involving other jurisdictions, or covert operations' and 'may be assigned to participate in cross-departmental and cross-agency planning teams.' This matches EC-11: 'Both single focused & cross functional; within one department although work may cross over into other departments. Identifies needs & provides technical direction in the design of alternative applications.' The scope does not reach EC-12 level (which involves providing leadership to significant technical/business projects with primary focus on managing processes for planning, executing, monitoring and delivering projects with direct impact on business success).

Supporting Evidence:
    • Designated as 'primary source of compliance and enforcement expertise, training, coaching and procedural support' - establishes subject-matter expert authority characteristic of EC-11 specialist roles
    • Responsibility for developing 'practical, legally-sound standards, policies and procedures' demonstrates policy development contribution expected at EC-11, not routine operational execution
    • Holds Special Constable appointment granting law enforcement authority - elevates decision-making autonomy and accountability beyond typical supervisory roles
    • Coordinates complex investigations, prosecutions, and joint operations with multiple agencies - demonstrates project management scope of small to medium-sized complex initiatives
    • Provides mentorship and training on specialized legal/investigative topics (search warrants, Charter rights, judicial processes) - indicates deep specialization and coaching responsibility
    • Contributes to departmental risk-based planning and provides input on legislation/regulation development - demonstrates strategic contribution beyond operational management
    • Manages cross-departmental and cross-agency coordination with federal agencies (DFO, CFIA, CBSA, CRA) - indicates relationship management scope beyond single-function operations
    • Conducts performance audits and analysis of inspections/investigations to ensure consistency - demonstrates quality assurance and process improvement responsibility
    • Does not manage complete business function or multiple functions - distinguishes from EC-12 level
    • Does not have responsibility for revenue/cost containment of significant importance - distinguishes from EC-12 level

Alternative Levels:
    • EC-10
    • EC-12

Comparable Positions:
    • Specialized enforcement supervisor roles in regulatory agencies typically classified at EC-11
    • Subject-matter expert supervisors with training and policy development responsibilities typically at EC-11
    • Compliance and enforcement coordinators managing complex investigations and inter-agency operations typically at EC-11
