TOOL 2: RE-EVALUATION GAUGE
================================================================================

Should Re-evaluate:
  YES

Confidence:
  92%

Current Level:
  EC-Unknown

Likely New Level Range:
  EC-11 to EC-12

Risk Assessment:
  HIGH

Rationale:
  The position has undergone substantial structural and scope elevation that materially exceeds typical EC-Unknown expectations. Key elevating factors: (1) Explicit requirement for Special Constable appointment with thorough knowledge of investigation techniques, evidence handling, charge-laying procedures, and court processes—this represents a significant legal/enforcement authority increase; (2) Independent decision-making in remote locations with minimal supervision, handling confrontational situations requiring rapid judgment in stressful contexts; (3) Responsibility for evidence custody, continuity, and storage for court cases—a critical accountability with legal implications; (4) Expanded inter-agency collaboration across federal agencies (CBSA, CFIA, DFO, CRA) requiring coordination and information-sharing at policy/operational levels; (5) Preparation of Crown briefs and legal documents requiring legal knowledge beyond standard inspection; (6) Consolidated accountability framework across five regulatory areas (fish buying/selling/processing, aquaculture, marine plants, recreational fishing, FHOSA) with explicit enforcement authority; (7) Enhanced physical and psychological working conditions (moderate vs. minimal) reflecting field enforcement realities. These changes collectively indicate a position requiring higher-level judgment, legal knowledge, inter-agency authority, and independent decision-making than typical EC-Unknown baseline. The role has shifted from compliance inspection toward enforcement investigation with prosecutorial support elements.

Key Factors:
    • Explicit Special Constable appointment requirement with thorough knowledge of investigation, evidence handling, and court procedures—represents legal authority elevation
    • Independent decision-making in remote locations with minimal on-site supervision, handling confrontational situations requiring rapid judgment
    • Responsibility for evidence custody, continuity, and storage for court cases—critical legal accountability
    • Preparation of Crown briefs and legal documents requiring specialized legal knowledge
    • Expanded inter-agency collaboration with federal agencies (CBSA, CFIA, DFO, CRA) at operational/policy levels
    • Consolidated enforcement authority across five regulatory areas with explicit SOT and long-form information issuance
    • Shift from compliance assistance (mobile vendor permits) to enforcement investigation and prosecution support
    • Enhanced working conditions (moderate physical/environmental) reflecting field enforcement realities

Categories Affected:
    • Accountabilities—significantly expanded to include legal document preparation, Crown briefs, evidence management, background checks, and consolidated multi-regulatory enforcement
    • Knowledge & Experience—elevated requirements for Special Constable appointment, investigation techniques, evidence handling, charge-laying procedures, court processes, and federal law knowledge
    • Decision Making—substantially enhanced with emphasis on independent judgment in remote locations, handling confrontational situations, logistical problem-solving (seizures), and evidence custody decisions
    • Customer & Relationship Management—shifted from customer service (permit assistance) to inter-agency collaboration with federal agencies on enforcement, information-sharing, and joint operations
    • Project Management—added joint operations planning with other agencies (minor elevation)
    • Working Conditions—physical and psychological environment elevated from minimal to moderate

TOOL 3: CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Position Title:
  Fisheries Inspector

Recommended Level:
  EC-11

Confidence:
  88%

Previous Level:
  EC-Unknown

Change Context Used:
  Yes

Rationale:
  The Fisheries Inspector position demonstrates substantial elevation in scope, authority, and complexity that aligns with EC-11 classification standards. The role combines specialized enforcement authority (Special Constable appointment), independent decision-making in complex regulatory environments, inter-agency collaboration, and significant legal/investigative responsibilities. Key elevating factors include: (1) Explicit Special Constable appointment with authority to conduct investigations, seize property, execute search warrants, lay charges, and prepare legal documents for court proceedings—representing significant legal enforcement authority; (2) Independent decision-making in remote locations with minimal supervision, handling confrontational situations, evidence custody decisions, and complex compliance determinations; (3) Broad accountability across multiple regulatory frameworks (FCRA, FHOSA, aquaculture, marine plants, recreational fishing) consolidated into single role; (4) Inter-agency collaboration with federal agencies (DFO, CFIA, CBSA, CRA) on enforcement, information-sharing, and joint operations; (5) Preparation of Crown briefs, legal documents, occurrence reports, and testimony in court proceedings. The position exceeds EC-10 (which involves managerial direction of small functions with routine operations) because it emphasizes specialized technical/enforcement expertise, complex investigative judgment, and legal authority rather than managerial oversight. It does not reach EC-12 (which requires managerial direction of business processes/functions or significant revenue/cost contributions) as the role is individual-contributor focused without supervisory responsibilities. EC-11 appropriately reflects the broad and deep knowledge required in complex enforcement fields, significant judgment in ambiguous situations, and technical specialization in fisheries law and investigation procedures.

Category Analysis:
    Accountabilities: EC-11 level. The position carries substantial individual accountability across multiple regulatory domains (fish buying/selling/processing, aquaculture, marine plants, recreational fishing, FHOSA). Responsibilities include conducting investigations, executing search warrants, seizing evidence, preparing legal documents, consulting with Crown Counsel, and attending court—all requiring independent judgment and specialized expertise. The consolidated accountability framework across all regulatory areas represents complexity beyond EC-10 (which involves managerial direction of small functions). The role does not include supervisory responsibility over staff, distinguishing it from EC-12 managerial positions. The breadth of technical accountability and requirement to provide input into policy/legislation development aligns with EC-11's expectation of 'takes a lead role in small to medium sized projects or routine operations' and 'acts as technical resource & advisor.'
    Knowledge Experience: EC-11 level. The position explicitly requires Special Constable appointment with thorough knowledge of investigation techniques, evidence handling, charge-laying procedures, court processes, and federal fisheries law. This represents 'broad &/or deep knowledge &/or fundamental understanding of concepts, principles & practices' and 'deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge' as defined in EC-11. The requirement to interpret and respond to inquiries about legislation from departmental staff, client groups, and provincial/federal law enforcement personnel demonstrates expert-level knowledge. The need to remain current through training, conferences, and seminars, combined with participation in policy development, indicates continuous advancement of specialized knowledge. This exceeds EC-10 (which requires 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field') by demonstrating deeper specialization and broader legal/investigative expertise.
    Decision Making: EC-11 level. The position requires analysis of complex issues where 'situations are often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required.' Examples include: determining compliance status for companies/individuals based on background checks and records audits; deciding appropriate enforcement actions (warnings, SOTs, informations, Ministerial Orders) based on investigation findings; recommending punitive actions and penalties; executing search warrants and seizing property; and consulting with Crown Counsel on legal strategy. The role operates with substantial autonomy in remote locations with minimal supervision, making independent judgments on confrontational situations and evidence custody decisions. The requirement to 'analyze information and evidence collected in order to recommend appropriate punitive action and penalty' demonstrates decision-making authority beyond routine application of rules. This exceeds EC-10 (which involves 'analyses specific issues, procedures & or products within clearly defined policies') because situations frequently lack clear procedural guidance.
    Customer Relationship: EC-11 level. The position involves sophisticated inter-agency collaboration with federal agencies (DFO, CFIA, CBSA, CRA, Environment Canada) on information-sharing, joint operations planning, and legislative/regulatory advice. This represents 'seeks our new avenues for building internal & external relationships; maintains on going, contact with existing relationships; coaches others on relationship management' as defined in EC-11. The role also involves responding to inquiries from departmental staff, client groups, and provincial/federal law enforcement personnel, requiring clear communication of complex regulatory requirements. Participation in joint inspections and enforcement operations with other agencies demonstrates collaborative relationship management. The position does not include primary responsibility for customer service enhancements or revenue/cost management that would elevate to EC-12.
    Leadership: EC-10/EC-11 boundary, trending toward EC-11. The position does not include formal supervisory responsibility over staff, which limits leadership classification. However, the role demonstrates leadership characteristics through: (1) providing technical expertise and advice to less experienced staff and other agencies; (2) participating in development of operational policies, procedures, and legislation; (3) providing input that influences departmental direction; (4) acting as subject matter expert in complex enforcement matters. The position 'seeks & provides candid & timely feedback to improve performance; shares information in an open manner, fosters teamwork & innovation by involving others' through inter-agency collaboration and committee participation. This aligns with EC-11's expectation of technical leadership without formal supervisory authority.
    Project Management: EC-11 level. The position involves planning and managing medium-complexity projects including: annual work plan development and scheduling; joint operations planning with multiple agencies; complex investigations spanning multiple sites and regulatory frameworks; and records audits requiring coordination across business and financial systems. The role requires 'identifies needs & provides technical direction in the design of alternative applications' through participation in policy and procedure development. While not managing large-scale cross-departmental initiatives, the position demonstrates project management capability consistent with EC-11's 'both single focused & cross functional; within one department although work may cross over into other departments.' The coordination of joint operations with federal and provincial agencies represents cross-functional project involvement.

Supporting Evidence:
    • Special Constable appointment with explicit authority to conduct investigations, execute search warrants, seize property, lay charges, and prepare legal documents—representing significant legal/enforcement authority beyond typical EC-10 positions
    • Independent decision-making in remote locations with minimal supervision, handling confrontational situations and complex compliance determinations where situations are 'often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required'
    • Consolidated accountability across five major regulatory frameworks (FCRA, FHOSA, aquaculture, marine plants, recreational fishing) requiring deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge
    • Inter-agency collaboration with federal agencies (DFO, CFIA, CBSA, CRA) on enforcement, information-sharing, and joint operations planning—demonstrating sophisticated relationship management
    • Preparation of Crown briefs, legal documents, occurrence reports, and court testimony—requiring specialized legal knowledge and technical expertise
    • Participation in development of operational policies, procedures, and legislation—indicating influence on departmental direction beyond routine operations
    • Requirement to interpret and respond to inquiries about legislation from departmental staff, client groups, and provincial/federal law enforcement—demonstrating expert-level knowledge
    • Absence of supervisory responsibility over staff distinguishes from EC-12 managerial positions; individual-contributor focus with technical specialization aligns with EC-11

Alternative Levels:
    • EC-10
    • EC-12

Comparable Positions:
    • Environmental/Conservation Enforcement Officers with investigation authority and inter-agency collaboration—typically EC-11
    • Specialized Compliance Inspectors with legal authority and independent decision-making in complex regulatory environments—typically EC-11
    • Senior Technical Specialists in enforcement/investigation roles without supervisory responsibility—typically EC-11
