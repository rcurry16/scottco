TOOL 2: RE-EVALUATION GAUGE
================================================================================

Should Re-evaluate:
  YES

Confidence:
  98%

Current Level:
  EC-10

Likely New Level Range:
  EC-10

Risk Assessment:
  LOW

Rationale:
  This is NOT a re-evaluation scenario but rather a COMPLETE POSITION RECLASSIFICATION that has already occurred. The position was previously classified as EC-07 (Senior Executive Administrative Coordinator) and has been reclassified to EC-10 (Unit Supervisor Secure Care). The changes are FUNDAMENTAL and MATERIAL across all six classification categories, representing a shift from executive office administration to direct supervision of youth workers in a secure care facility with significantly elevated accountabilities, decision-making authority, and working conditions. The current classification of EC-10 appears APPROPRIATE and JUSTIFIED for the new role scope. No further elevation beyond EC-10 is warranted based on the position description provided.

Key Factors:
    • Complete role transformation: Executive office administration → Direct supervision of 25+ Youth Workers in secure care facility
    • Accountability elevation: From supporting executive functions to direct responsibility for youth safety, security, treatment planning, and crisis intervention
    • Decision-making authority: From office operations decisions to decisions with life-safety consequences (restraint authorization, isolation room approval, medication administration, emergency response)
    • Leadership scope: From administrative staff supervision to direct supervision of 25+ Youth Workers + indirect supervision of interdisciplinary team (nurses, doctors, psychologists, social workers, teachers)
    • Knowledge requirements: Shift from government processes to specialized knowledge of NCI, ACM, Children and Family Services Act, Provincial Standards, health care administration, behavioral management
    • Working conditions: Shift from comfortable office environment to secure facility with exposure to physically/verbally aggressive residents, high sensory demands, rotating shifts, and psychological pressures
    • Legal/regulatory accountability: New authority to issue Secure Treatment Certificates and LOAs under Children and Family Services Act; compliance with Provincial Standards and Child Abuse Protocol
    • Crisis management: New accountability for managing crisis situations including restraint, isolation, elopement response, and serious incident investigations
    • Acting Facility Manager role: Off-hours responsibility for entire facility operations, maintenance, and emergency decision-making

Categories Affected:
    • Accountabilities - MAJOR CHANGE: From executive office coordination to direct supervision and treatment plan implementation in secure care
    • Knowledge & Experience - MAJOR CHANGE: From government administration to youth care, behavioral management, legal/regulatory compliance, health care coordination
    • Decision Making - MAJOR CHANGE: From office operations to life-safety decisions with potential for serious injury/death consequences
    • Customer & Relationship Management - MAJOR CHANGE: From senior government officials to youth residents, parents/guardians, law enforcement, legal representatives, health care providers
    • Leadership - MAJOR CHANGE: From supporting executive leadership to direct supervision of 25+ staff and indirect supervision of interdisciplinary team
    • Project Management - MAJOR CHANGE: From executive office projects to treatment plan implementation, crisis intervention coordination, resident reintegration, facility operations


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOOL 3: CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Position Title:
  Unit Supervisor Secure Care

Recommended Level:
  EC-10

Confidence:
  82%

Previous Level:
  EC-10

Change Context Used:
  Yes

Rationale:
  This position appropriately remains classified at EC-10 (Manager/Consultant). The role demonstrates managerial direction over a small operating unit (25+ Youth Workers) with specialized knowledge in secure youth care, behavioral management, and crisis intervention. The position exhibits clear EC-10 characteristics: (1) provides managerial direction for a small function/operating unit of skilled support staff; (2) possesses specialized knowledge in secure care operations with understanding of business processes within the functional unit; (3) makes decisions within clearly defined policies and provincial standards with some autonomy on operational matters; (4) manages medium-complexity projects including treatment plan implementation and facility operations; (5) establishes and communicates goals for the team while coaching on problem-solving and teamwork. The position does not meet EC-11 criteria, which require broader/deeper knowledge across multiple business processes, lead roles in medium-sized projects, or decision-making in grey/ambiguous situations requiring significant judgment beyond defined procedures. While the position involves life-safety decisions and complex crisis management, these occur within clearly defined Provincial Standards, NCI protocols, and established procedures—not the ambiguous, grey-area decision-making characteristic of EC-11. The reclassification from EC-07 (Senior Executive Administrative Coordinator) to EC-10 represents a fundamental shift from administrative support to direct operational supervision, which is appropriately captured at the EC-10 level.

Category Analysis:
    Accountabilities: EC-10 level. The position provides managerial direction for a small operating unit (25+ Youth Workers) in a secure care facility. Key accountabilities include: direct supervision and professional development of staff; treatment plan implementation and ACM supervision; crisis intervention management; health care coordination including medication administration; facility operations and security; and compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks (Provincial Standards, Children and Family Services Act, OH&S Legislation). These represent operational management of a defined function rather than strategic direction across multiple functions. The position has clear scope boundaries (the secure care unit) and operates within established procedures and standards, consistent with EC-10's 'provides managerial direction for small function(s)/operating units' criterion. Does not reach EC-11 level which requires direction of multiple functions or operations not always covered by defined procedure.
    Knowledge Experience: EC-10 level. The position requires specialized knowledge in: secure youth care operations; behavioral management and Non-Violent Crisis Intervention (NCI) techniques; treatment planning and case management; health care coordination; Provincial Standards for Residential Child-Caring Facilities; Children and Family Services Act; Child Abuse Protocol; and OH&S legislation. This represents 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field with understanding of business processes, particularly those within functional unit' (EC-10 standard). The position demonstrates understanding of how the secure care unit operates within the broader Department of Community Services, but does not require the 'broad and/or deep knowledge of fundamental understanding of concepts, principles and practices' across multiple business processes required for EC-11. The specialized focus on secure care operations and facility management aligns with EC-10's specialized field knowledge.
    Decision Making: EC-10 level. The position makes decisions within clearly defined policies, principles, and specific objectives: Provincial Standards for Residential Child-Caring Facilities, NCI protocols, Children and Family Services Act, facility policies, and established procedures. Examples include: approving use of Secure Isolation Rooms (within Provincial Standards); issuing Secure Treatment Certificates and LOAs (within statutory authority); deploying staff and managing performance; initiating crisis interventions (following NCI techniques); and coordinating health services (with on-site health personnel). While these decisions can have serious consequences (safety of youth and staff), they are made within clearly defined frameworks and established procedures. The position 'analyses specific issues, procedures & or products within clearly defined policies, principles & specific objectives' and 'provides recommendations on improving procedure & processes'—both EC-10 criteria. Does not meet EC-11 criterion of 'situations are often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required' beyond defined procedures.
    Customer Relationship: EC-10 level. The position maintains extensive internal and external relationships: internal contacts with interdisciplinary team (nurses, doctors, psychologists, social workers, teachers, facility management); external contacts with police services, attorneys, legal aid counsel, parents/guardians, provincial ombudsman, community groups, and agency social workers. The position 'assists in the development & implementation of customer service enhancements in own functional area' through coordination with teachers on classroom behavior management, collaboration with clinical services on program delivery, and liaison with community agencies on resident reintegration. The position 'seeks out new avenues for building internal & external relationships; maintains on going contact with existing relationships; coaches others on relationship management'—consistent with EC-10. The scope is primarily within the functional unit (secure care operations) rather than cross-functional or divisional relationship building required for higher levels.
    Leadership: EC-10 level. The position 'establishes & communicates common goals & direction for team, coaches others on how to enhance communication, problem solving team work & innovation.' Specific evidence includes: direct supervision of 25+ Youth Workers; indirect supervision of interdisciplinary team; role modeling of problem-solving strategies and techniques; delegation of assignments; participation in recruitment and performance evaluation; promotion of diversity and healthy workplace; and demonstration of leadership competencies. The position reports to Facility Manager/Senior Unit Supervisor (consistent with EC-10's 'Usually reports to a Manager or Director'). The leadership scope is bounded to the unit level rather than the broader functional area or cross-functional coordination required for EC-11. The position develops staff through supervision and coaching within established frameworks rather than providing strategic direction or vision.
    Project Management: EC-10 level. The position manages medium-complexity projects within the functional unit: treatment plan implementation for multiple residents; crisis intervention coordination; facility operations management; resident reintegration initiatives; and health care service coordination. The position 'manages medium complex to moderately complex projects, accountable for quality of work delivered by external suppliers, as applicable; identifies resources.' Examples include: supervising implementation of individualized treatment plans; coordinating psycho-educational programming; managing facility schedules and operations; and overseeing community/agency involvement. Projects are 'single focused & cross functional; within one department although work may cross over into other departments.' The position does not lead major province-wide or cross-departmental initiatives, nor does it provide strategic direction to project initiatives—characteristics of EC-11 and above.

Supporting Evidence:
    • Direct supervision of 25+ Youth Workers with responsibility for professional development, deployment, and performance management—clear EC-10 managerial direction criterion
    • Decision-making authority bounded by clearly defined Provincial Standards, NCI protocols, Children and Family Services Act, and facility policies—EC-10 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies, principles & specific objectives' rather than EC-11's grey/ambiguous situations
    • Specialized knowledge in secure youth care operations, behavioral management, and crisis intervention within a defined functional unit—EC-10 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field with understanding of business processes within functional unit'
    • Life-safety decisions (restraints, isolation rooms, medication administration, crisis response) made within established protocols and procedures, not requiring the independent judgment in ambiguous situations characteristic of EC-11
    • Scope limited to single operating unit (secure care facility) rather than multiple functions or division-wide operations required for EC-11
    • Reports to Facility Manager/Senior Unit Supervisor, consistent with EC-10 reporting structure to Manager or Director
    • Management of medium-complexity projects (treatment plans, facility operations, reintegration) within one department, consistent with EC-10 project management scope

Alternative Levels:
    • EC-09
    • EC-11

Comparable Positions:
    • Unit Supervisor in residential care facilities—typically EC-10 when supervising 20+ direct reports with operational responsibility
    • Facility Operations Manager in secure/correctional settings—typically EC-10 when managing single facility operations within defined standards
    • Program Supervisor in youth services—typically EC-10 when supervising staff and managing treatment/program delivery within established frameworks
