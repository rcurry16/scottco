  "rationale": "The position description has been materially elevated across multiple classification categories, moving beyond typical EC-10 expectations. While EC-10 positions 'may take a leader role in small projects or routine operations,' this revised description explicitly positions the PRA as leading complex policy formulation, implementation, and research initiatives—a scope that approaches EC-11 expectations. Key elevations include: (1) Accountabilities now include leading comprehensive policy analysis and research, building strategic stakeholder relationships, and providing mentorship—moving from supporting others to actively leading and developing colleagues; (2) Decision-making authority has expanded from 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies' to leading development of new policy and legislative frameworks addressing 'complex and emerging issues'; (3) Leadership responsibilities now explicitly include mentorship and contributing to organizational culture—typical of EC-11 rather than EC-10; (4) Project management scope elevated from managing 'medium complex to moderately complex projects' to leading development of policy and legislative frameworks. The language shift from 'advising' to 'provides high-level analysis, strategic advice, and well-developed recommendations to inform decision-making by senior leadership' and from 'may be required' to 'is frequently called upon' indicates increased autonomy and strategic influence. However, the position remains within a single functional area (policy and research) under clear supervisory direction (Director approval required for expenditures and final recommendations), which prevents classification at EC-11 or higher with certainty. The mentorship component is situational rather than permanent, and no direct reports are managed. This positions the role at the upper boundary of EC-10 or lower EC-11, warranting formal re-evaluation to determine appropriate placement.",

    "Explicit elevation from 'conducting' to 'leading' complex policy formulation and implementation initiatives—moves beyond EC-10 'may take a leader role' language",

    "Increased autonomy in determining methodology and approach to assignments—moves toward EC-11 'significant autonomy' language",
