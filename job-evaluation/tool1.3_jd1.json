  "position_title": "Administrative Support - Deputy Superintendent, Cumberland Correctional Facility",
  "recommended_level": "EC-05",
  "confidence": 78,
  "previous_level": null,
  "rationale": "This position demonstrates the complexity, independence, and coordination responsibilities characteristic of EC-05 (Coordinator/Assistant/Secretary). The incumbent manages a substantial range of complex clerical and administrative assignments requiring independent analysis and judgment, coordinates work across multiple correctional facilities, maintains critical confidential records, and performs specialized technical tasks (sentence calculations, JEIN data entry, offender file management). The position requires considerable clerical experience and comprehensive knowledge of correctional procedures, policies, and government operations. Decision-making involves judgment in interpreting administrative directives and handling situations not always covered by standard procedures (e.g., identifying problematic situations, making routine administrative decisions in the Deputy Superintendent's absence). The role includes coordination responsibilities across multiple facilities and stakeholder groups, and the incumbent is expected to improve processes through innovation and tool creation. While the position does not include formal supervisory responsibility over other staff, it demonstrates the specialized nature, independence of action, and increased complexity that distinguishes EC-05 from lower clerical levels (EC-01 through EC-04). The position falls short of EC-06 and above, which require more substantial supervisory leadership, broader strategic involvement, or management of larger operational units.",
  "category_analysis": {
    "accountabilities": "EC-05 level. The position involves a variety of responsible and complex clerical assignments requiring independent analysis and exercise of judgment. Key responsibilities include: monitoring policy implementation, tracking administrative performance standards, managing confidential records (investigations, allegations, grievances, offender records), performing specialized technical tasks (JEIN data entry, sentence calculations as second-level check), maintaining multiple file systems (manual, Star, Stor), managing petty cash with signing authority, and coordinating room bookings across facilities. These go beyond routine clerical tasks (EC-01/EC-02) and represent the 'more complex clerical assignments' and 'more technical clerical or support tasks' characteristic of EC-05. The position coordinates work across multiple facilities (Cumberland and Antigonish), indicating broader scope than single-location support roles.",
    "knowledge_experience": "EC-05 level. The position requires considerable clerical experience and comprehensive knowledge of work procedures. Specific knowledge domains include: correctional facility operations and policies, JEIN system administration, sentence calculation procedures, offender record management, SAP and Learn Net systems, government administrative procedures, and confidentiality protocols. The incumbent must understand how the Deputy Superintendent's office functions relate to broader Correctional Services operations and the Justice Department. This represents 'significant relevant experience' and 'solid understanding of the work function' as defined in EC-05, exceeding the 'several years of relevant experience' required at EC-03 and approaching but not reaching the 'broad knowledge of business processes' required at EC-06+.",
    "decision_making": "EC-05 level. Decision-making involves judgment in interpretation and application of administrative directives and procedures, with some situations not clearly covered by standard procedures. The incumbent makes routine daily decisions regarding administrative requirements while adhering to deadlines and priorities. Examples include: correcting errors in sentence administration and calculations, referring matters requiring internal/external resources, identifying potentially problematic situations, and working independently in the Deputy Superintendent's absence. The position description explicitly states the incumbent 'uses sound judgement, discretion and maintaining high level of confidentiality' and must 'identify potentially problematic situations.' This matches EC-05's 'decision making involves judgment in the interpretation & application of administrative directives' with situations 'frequently necessitating consultation with supervisor.' It exceeds EC-04's more structured decision-making but lacks the broader autonomy and problem-resolution scope of EC-06+.",
    "customer_relationship": "EC-05 level. The position maintains regular contact with persons at all levels of the organization, including: Executive Director, Directors, Superintendents, Deputy Superintendents across 6 facilities, Managers, Provincial Program Officers, staff at all levels of Correctional Services and Justice Departments, Senior Probation and Probation Officers, Sheriffs, Court Services, Public Prosecution Service, Human Resources, and external stakeholders including Ombudsmen Office. The incumbent performs reception duties, responds to telephone/mail/email enquiries, and maintains relationships on behalf of the Deputy Superintendent. This matches EC-05's 'regular contact with persons at all levels of the organization, industry, customers/clients & the community' and represents the expanded relationship management scope beyond EC-04.",
    "leadership": "Below EC-05 threshold for formal leadership. The position description contains no indication of supervisory responsibility or instruction/guidance of other staff. The incumbent works independently and is expected to improve processes and seek to enhance own performance, which aligns with EC-05's expectation to 'establish co-operative relationships' and 'support others' as a team member, but does not include the 'responsibility for instruction & guidance of other Administrative Support Clerks' noted in EC-05. This is a minor gap from full EC-05 alignment but does not lower the overall classification as other categories strongly support EC-05.",
    "project_management": "EC-05 level. The position begins to participate in and manage parts of projects. Examples include: organizing workflow according to importance and deadline, creating tools and systems (spreadsheets, tracking forms, schedules, calendars) to improve processes and ensure deadlines are met, managing room bookings for training and case conferences, and coordinating data entry and tracking across multiple systems. The incumbent is expected to 'seek to improve processes by implementing new ideas' and create tools to support facility operations. This matches EC-05's 'begins to participate on &/or manage parts of projects' and represents more than the 'well-defined practices & procedures' of lower levels."
