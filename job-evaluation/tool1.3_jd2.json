  "position_title": "Financial Advisor, Regional Services Branch",
  "recommended_level": "EC-11",
  "confidence": 78,
  "previous_level": null,
  "rationale": "This position demonstrates the characteristics of EC-11 (Manager/Consultant) based on comprehensive analysis across all six categories. The incumbent provides managerial direction over financial functions for a large branch with 275 permanent and 462 seasonal employees, manages complex financial systems and processes, and provides strategic recommendations to the Executive Director on budget allocation and financial risk management. The role requires broad and deep knowledge of accounting principles (GAAP), government financial policies, and multiple business processes within the Regional Services Branch. Decision-making involves significant judgment in interpreting policies and procedures, with authority to establish financial priorities and objectives, though final budget allocations require Executive Director approval. The position supervises indirectly through five FSO1 positions and provides training/guidance to branch financial staff. Project management includes designing and implementing branch financial systems and leading auditing initiatives. The complexity, scope of financial oversight across 13 diverse programs, requirement for professional accounting designation, and strategic advisory role to senior executive leadership align with EC-11 rather than lower coordinator levels (EC-05 through EC-10) which lack this breadth of financial system responsibility and strategic influence, or higher director levels (EC-12+) which would require direct management of multiple functions or cross-departmental strategic initiatives beyond this role's scope.",
  "category_analysis": {
    "accountabilities": "EC-11 level. The position provides managerial direction for financial functions/processes within the Regional Services Branch operating unit. Responsibilities include managing accounting functions (payroll, accounts payable/receivable, procurement, inventory, asset management, budgeting, forecasting, reporting), developing financial networks across departments, leading financial risk management activities, designing financial systems, and coordinating with financial staff. This represents 'managerial direction for a specific business process/function' characteristic of EC-11, exceeding the coordination and support focus of EC-05 through EC-10, but not reaching the multi-function or divisional scope of EC-12+.",
    "knowledge_experience": "EC-11 level. The position requires 'broad and/or deep knowledge of fundamental understanding of concepts, principles and practices' in accounting and financial management. Specific requirements include: GAAP expertise, government financial policies and procedures, accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA, PPA) as assets, understanding of multiple business processes (payroll, asset management, budgeting, forecasting, auditing), and knowledge of how financial functions integrate across the branch and department. This depth of specialized knowledge in a specific functional area (financial management) with understanding of business processes aligns with EC-11 rather than lower levels which require less comprehensive knowledge.",
    "decision_making": "EC-11 level. The incumbent 'analyses specific issues, procedures and products' and 'provides recommendations on improving procedure and processes where situations are often grey and/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required.' Examples include: deciding methodology to maximize accuracy of financial reports, making recommendations on fund reallocation to meet changing priorities, developing new methodologies where no current process exists, and providing policy and resource allocation recommendations to the Executive Director. While final budget allocations require Executive Director approval, the incumbent has autonomy to establish financial priorities, objectives, and deadlines. This represents the judgment-based decision-making of EC-11, exceeding the structured decision-making of lower levels.",
    "customer_relationship": "EC-11 level. The position 'assists in the development and implementation of customer service enhancements in own functional area' through maintaining effective communications with stakeholders, building consensus through monthly meetings and committee participation, and liaising with management across department sections. The incumbent develops and maintains financial networks with other department branches, Financial Services, provincial departments/agencies, and external suppliers/vendors. This represents the relationship-building and stakeholder management characteristic of EC-11, with focus on internal and external relationships within the functional area.",
    "leadership": "EC-11 level. The position demonstrates leadership through: establishing and communicating priorities and objectives for branch financial functions, designing and conducting training for branch financial staff and clerks, providing guidance and oversight to five FSO1 positions (indirect reports), and facilitating presentations and committee participation. The incumbent 'seeks and provides candid and timely feedback to improve performance' through ongoing reviews and audits. This represents the coaching and team development focus of EC-11, though without direct supervisory authority over the FSO1 positions (they report to Branch Directors), which distinguishes this from higher management levels with direct reports.",
    "project_management": "EC-11 level. The position 'takes a lead role in small to medium sized projects' including designing and implementing branch financial systems, leading auditing and investigation design/implementation/monitoring, and managing capital program audit requests. The incumbent 'identifies needs and provides technical direction in the design of alternative applications' for financial systems. This represents the project leadership scope of EC-11, managing projects within the functional area with supervisor support, rather than the broader cross-functional project management of EC-12+."
