  "position_title": "Policy Analyst",
  "recommended_level": "EC-11",
  "confidence": 78,
  "previous_level": null,
  "rationale": "This position demonstrates the complexity, autonomy, and scope characteristic of EC-11 (Manager/Consultant). The incumbent formulates high-quality policy alternatives through thorough analysis, conducts sophisticated research on complex regulatory matters, and provides policy advice and recommendations directly to senior leadership including the Minister, CEO, and Associate Deputy Minister. The position requires broad and deep knowledge of multiple regulatory domains (consumer financial rights, real estate, condominiums, mortgage brokers, petroleum regulation, residential tenancies, funeral sector) and demonstrates decision-making autonomy within defined scope—determining methodology for policy projects, conducting jurisdictional scans, and economic analysis. While the position has no permanent direct reports, it may supervise research and administrative staff on an as-needed basis. The work involves managing medium-complexity policy projects, engaging with federal/provincial counterparts and external stakeholders, and contributing to legislative agenda advancement. The position operates at a level above routine policy coordination (EC-10) but below strategic divisional direction (EC-12), as it focuses on policy formulation and implementation within assigned areas rather than managing business processes or functions. The requirement to develop subject-matter expertise, present to Cabinet committees, and provide advice on complex regulatory issues (petroleum hearings, payday lending) indicates the analytical depth and professional judgment expected at EC-11.",
  "category_analysis": {
    "accountabilities": "EC-11 level. The position formulates policy alternatives through thorough analysis, leads/coordinates implementation of policy and legislative changes, develops and maintains subject-matter expertise across multiple regulatory domains, and contributes to legislative agenda administration. These responsibilities exceed routine coordination (EC-10) by requiring independent formulation of policy alternatives and strategic input to senior decision-makers. The position is assigned projects by the Director but determines methodology independently, indicating substantial autonomy within scope. However, accountability remains focused on policy development and research support rather than managing business functions or divisions, which distinguishes this from EC-12.",
    "knowledge_experience": "EC-11 level. The position requires broad and/or deep knowledge of multiple regulatory domains and fundamental understanding of policy principles and practices. The incumbent must develop and maintain subject-matter expertise in consumer financial rights, real estate, condominiums, mortgage brokers, petroleum regulation, residential tenancies, and funeral sector—demonstrating the 'broad &/or deep knowledge of concepts, principles & practices' specified at EC-11. The position engages with federal/provincial counterparts, conducts jurisdictional scans, and performs economic/statistical analysis, indicating professional-level expertise. This exceeds the general knowledge of specific processes (EC-10) and approaches the deep specialization in complex fields characteristic of EC-11.",
    "decision_making": "EC-11 level. The position determines methodology for policy projects based on professional knowledge and broader policy environment, demonstrating decision-making autonomy within defined scope. The incumbent may seek guidance from senior policy analysts or the Director, but final advice/recommendations are subject to review and approval—indicating structured autonomy typical of EC-11 ('has decision-making & autonomy needed to deliver on accountabilities of job/role; seeks approval from others on matters outside of job/role scope'). The position must obtain Director approval for expenditures, showing appropriate oversight boundaries. The requirement to analyze complex issues, perform research, and provide recommendations on ambiguous matters (adapting programs from other jurisdictions, addressing emerging regulatory issues) reflects the judgment required at EC-11 where 'situations are often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required.'",
    "customer_relationship": "EC-11 level. The position engages with federal, provincial, and municipal officials; business and consumer sector stakeholders; and self-governing boards and commissions. The incumbent represents Government of Nova Scotia interests to external bodies and engages with central agency resources and senior corporate strategists. This demonstrates the relationship-building and stakeholder management expected at EC-11 ('seeks our new avenues for building internal & external relationships; maintains on going, contact with existing relationships; coaches others on relationships'). The position supports informed decision-making through engagement with diverse stakeholders and provides advice to senior leadership, exceeding routine customer contact management.",
    "leadership": "EC-10/EC-11 boundary. The position has no permanent direct reports but may supervise research and administrative staff on an as-needed basis. This situational supervisory responsibility is lighter than the team leadership expected at EC-11 ('may lead a work group or project team'). However, the position acts as a technical resource and advisor through subject-matter expertise development and may have functional reporting relationships to senior policy analysts appointed as Deputy Registrars. The position demonstrates initiative in learning about the organization and developing external contacts, consistent with EC-11 expectations. The lack of permanent team leadership slightly moderates this category but does not override the overall EC-11 classification driven by other factors.",
    "project_management": "EC-11 level. The position plans, leads, coordinates, or supports implementation of policy, legislative, program, or regulatory changes—managing small to medium-sized policy projects. The incumbent may be assigned policy projects by the Director but determines methodology independently, indicating project management autonomy. The position contributes to legislative agenda advancement through coordination with Legal Counsel, Registry of Regulations, Legislative Counsel, and Communications, demonstrating cross-functional project coordination. This aligns with EC-11 ('takes a lead role in small to medium sized projects or routine operations') and exceeds EC-10 routine project participation. The position does not manage complex operational projects or provide strategic direction to project teams, which would indicate EC-12."
