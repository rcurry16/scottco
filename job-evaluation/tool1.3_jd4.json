  "position_title": "Director, Service Delivery (Department of Community Services)",
  "recommended_level": "EC-14",
  "confidence": 82,
  "previous_level": null,
  "rationale": "This position demonstrates executive-level leadership with strategic responsibility for a major division within a large, complex department. The role provides direction to multiple business processes and functions across geographically dispersed service delivery teams, with significant impact on divisional operations and long-term strategic responsibility. The position leads multiple Directors, manages substantial budgets with departmental-wide impact, and holds decision-making authority across multiple functions. The incumbent acts for the Executive Director during prolonged absences and provides strategic advice to senior government officials. This aligns with EC-14 criteria: direction to multiple business processes/multi-function teams, significant divisional impact with core long-term strategic responsibility, broad knowledge of many business processes with deep expertise, decision-making authority across multiple functions, and responsibility for strategic direction of major initiatives. The position exceeds EC-13 (single large business function) by managing multiple program areas and functions across the entire Service Delivery division. It does not reach EC-15 (departmental-level executive direction) as the scope is divisional rather than departmental-wide, though the role has significant cross-departmental influence.",

The position acts as 'key influencer to others cross functionally' and provides strategic advice to Executive Director, Deputy Minister, and Minister. This exceeds EC-13's authority within a single function and demonstrates the multi-functional decision-making autonomy of EC-14.",

Responsibilities include: representing the Department at senior tables with members of the public, government, other officials, Office of the Ombudsmen, policing agencies, community-based agencies, health professionals, lawyers, courts, and others.
