  "rationale": "The position has been materially elevated across multiple classification dimensions, moving beyond typical EC-10 expectations. The revaluation gauge (88% confidence, EC-10 to EC-11 range) provides strong input supporting this assessment. Key evidence: (1) Accountabilities explicitly position the PRA as 'leading complex policy formulation, implementation, and research initiatives'—moving from EC-10's 'may take a leader role in small projects' to EC-11's 'takes a lead role in small to medium sized projects.' (2) Knowledge requirements now emphasize 'deep subject-matter expertise' and explicit mentorship responsibilities, aligning with EC-11's 'deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge' rather than EC-10's general technical knowledge. (3) Decision-making authority has expanded from 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies' (EC-10) to designing and leading development of policy frameworks for 'complex and emerging issues' where 'situations are often grey &/or ambiguous' (EC-11 language). (4) Customer/relationship management elevated from 'assists in development' to 'builds and maintains strategic relationships' as a core accountability. (5) Leadership now includes explicit mentorship and culture-building contributions. (6) Project management scope shifted from managing 'medium complex to moderately complex projects' to leading development of 'new or revised policy and legislative frameworks.' The position remains within one functional area (Legislation and Policy) with no permanent direct reports, preventing EC-12+ classification. EC-11 represents the appropriate fit for this elevated scope.",
  "category_analysis": {
    "accountabilities": "EC-11. The position description explicitly states the PRA is 'responsible for leading complex policy formulation, implementation, and research initiatives' and 'designs and leads the development of new or revised policy and legislative frameworks.' This moves beyond EC-10's 'may take a leader role in small projects or routine operations' to EC-11's 'takes a lead role in small to medium sized projects.' The PRA provides 'high-level analysis, strategic advice, and well-developed recommendations to inform decision-making by senior leadership' and 'provides guidance and mentorship to colleagues on policy development processes and research methodologies.' These are core EC-11 accountability markers. The scope includes drafting Executive Council submissions, advising Cabinet committees, and engaging with federal/provincial counterparts—all indicating elevated responsibility within a specialized function.",
    "knowledge_experience": "EC-11. The position requires 'deep subject-matter expertise on current and emerging issues' across multiple regulatory domains (consumer financial rights, real estate, condominiums, mortgage brokers, petroleum regulation, residential tenancies, funeral sector). This aligns with EC-11's 'broad &/or deep knowledge &/or fundamental understanding of concepts, principles & practices' and 'deep specialization in complex fields of knowledge.' The requirement to mentor colleagues on research methodologies and lead comprehensive policy analysis indicates knowledge depth beyond EC-10's 'knowledge in technical, scientific or specialized field.' The PRA must understand regulatory policy requirements, perform program evaluation, and engage with central agency resources—demonstrating sophisticated understanding of government processes and business context.",
    "decision_making": "EC-11. The position description states the PRA 'determines the methodology used to undertake these assignments based on professional knowledge' and is 'frequently called upon to design and lead the development of new or revised policy and legislative frameworks that address complex and emerging issues.' This directly matches EC-11's decision-making standard: 'Analyses specific issues, procedures & or products' and 'Provides recommendations on improving procedure & processes where situations are often grey &/or ambiguous; significant judgement is required.' The PRA develops 'forward-looking recommendations and advice through sophisticated research, environmental scanning, and the application of creative and strategic thinking.' While final advice is subject to Director review, the PRA has substantial autonomy in methodology and analysis approach—exceeding EC-10's 'analyses specific issues within clearly defined policies, principles & specific objectives.'",
    "customer_relationship": "EC-11. The position explicitly includes 'builds and maintains strategic relationships with key stakeholders to support effective implementation of legislative and program changes' as a core accountability. This moves beyond EC-10's 'seeks our new avenues for building internal & external relationships; maintains on going, contact with existing relationships; coaches others on relationships.' The PRA engages with federal/provincial counterparts, business and community stakeholders, self-governing boards and commissions, and represents 'the interests of the Government of Nova Scotia to external bodies.' The scope of external engagement (Consumer Measures Committee, interdepartmental resources, sector stakeholders) and the strategic nature of these relationships (supporting policy implementation, regulatory modernization) align with EC-11's elevated relationship management expectations.",
    "leadership": "EC-11. While the position has no permanent direct reports, it includes explicit leadership and mentorship responsibilities: 'Provides guidance and mentorship to colleagues on policy development processes and research methodologies, contributing to a culture of analytical rigor and innovation.' The PRA may supervise Research and Statistical Officers or administrative staff on an as-needed basis. This matches EC-11's leadership standard: 'Establishes & communicates common goals & direction for team, coaches others on how to enhance communication, problem solving team work & innovation.' The mentorship component and culture-building contribution represent leadership beyond EC-10's typical scope, positioning the PRA as a thought leader within the policy function.",
    "project_management": "EC-11. The position description emphasizes that the PRA 'plans, leads, coordinates, or supports the implementation of policy, legislative, program, or regulatory changes' and is 'frequently called upon to design and lead the development of new or revised policy and legislative frameworks.' This aligns with EC-11's 'Both single focused & cross functional; within one department although work may cross over into other departments' and 'Identifies needs & provides technical direction in the design of alternative applications.' The scope includes complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives (e.g., adapting innovative consumer protection programs, advancing legislative agenda through Executive Council submissions). While projects remain within the policy/legislative domain, the complexity and strategic nature exceed EC-10's 'manages medium complex to moderately complex projects.'"
